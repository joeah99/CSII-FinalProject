# CSII-FinalProject
(Created by myself and Riley Camelin) A mini social media platform that creates and saves accounts and posts via an SQL database, allows users to make friends lists, and lets them sort their feeds. This was inspired and modified from an existing 'Jstagram' project to incorporate a SQL database.
